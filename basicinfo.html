	<p>I was born in Littleton, Colorado where I also grew up. My family consists of me, my parents, and my four siblings. As a kid I really enjoyed baking, reading, and playing the piano. In high school I loved to run and swim and also participated in choir and musicals. As a college student I currently alternate between sleeping, working, going to class, and studying in the library, but I really enjoy Brigham Young University and am grateful for the opportunity I have to be attending this school and receive a higher education. </p>
